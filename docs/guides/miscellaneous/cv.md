## About Me

Welcome to Professional Background section. This area serves as a living document of my professional journey.

`**Summary:**`

I tend to involve myself in a bit of everything—from infrastructure to automation—preferring a broad approach to IT challenges. I am also deeply committed to the **Open Source** philosophy and believe in the importance of shared knowledge.
